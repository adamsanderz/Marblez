I know what you are thinking...
"That last level is impossible, 
it cannot be completed!"

I agree with you!

I was never able to beat it either, 
not on the Amiga, or on the emulator.
(I think the original was 
designed not to be beatable)

But you have beaten all the 
other levels, so I'm going 
to give you this level
& you can say you won.

I hope you enjoyed this game, I did :-)
