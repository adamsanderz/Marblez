# Marblez
Unity port of Amiga game Toobz
http://www.mobygames.com/game/toobz

# Description
This is the source code for my game on Kongregate (http://www.kongregate.com/games/MarkGossage/marblez/)
Originally written in Unity 4.4 using Orthello, but then reworked to Unity 5.6 and UGUI and USprites.

Its not particually clear code (I'm always learning better ways to work) and a couple of chunks of code are very ugly (mainly where I designed for Othello, then ported to UGUI).
But the Kongregrate code (Kongregate.cs, KongTest.cs & KongTest.Unity and the Kongregate webgl template are useful)

# Compiling
You can just play it http://www.kongregate.com/games/MarkGossage/marblez/
It should work out of the box on Unity 5.6.0f3 personal

You might have some issues with the webgl template, that was the biggest issue with the port to html5.

## WebGL notes
Most of the Kongregate webgl notes are a bit inaccuate, also Unity webgl format seems to have changed between 5.4 and 5.6.
So here I what I did.

1. Get the game working (You could create a game and just add KongTest)
2. Set the player platform to webGL
3. Open the Player Settings
..* Screen size 940x620 (its 20px smaller than the Kongregate 960x640 size, to avoid scrollbars being added)
4. Select the Kongregate template
..* This template is the original Unity template, the extra links removed and the Kong javascript added
..* Because of CORS issues (developers.kongregate.com/blog/unity-html5-cors-and-you) I added both http & https
5. Build it, zip it all up with index.html in the top directory
6. Upload app as a Unity Application, but only upload the html5 version (ignore the warning about use html5)
